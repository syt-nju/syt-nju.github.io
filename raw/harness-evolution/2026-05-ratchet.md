                                                    human-curated ones deliver +16.2pp (2): the bottleneck is not skill authoring
                                                    but lifecycle management. We introduce Ratchet, a single-agent loop in which a
                                                    frozen LLM writes, retrieves, curates, and retires its own natural-language skills.
                                                    Ratchet integrates four candidate hygiene mechanisms: outcome-driven retirement,
                                                    a bounded active-cap, meta-skill authoring guidance, and pattern canonicalisation.
                                                    On MBPP+ hard-100 with Claude Opus 4.7, Ratchet lifts held-out pass@1 from
                                                    a 0.258 ± 0.047 baseline to a late-window rolling mean of 0.584 (peak 0.658 ±
                                                    0.042) across 100 rounds and 3 seeds, a +0.328 ± 0.018 rolling-mean gain where
                                                    the no-skill control drifts at +0.002 ± 0.005; the same recipe transfers to an
                                                    agentic solver on SWE-bench Verified (+0.22 peak lift over 20 rounds). Eight
                                                    ablations (A1–A8) reveal that the minimal working recipe is smaller than our design
                                                    suggests: retirement and the meta-skill authoring prior are load-bearing, while
                                                    explicit deduplication (canonicalisation, cover-guard) is subsumed by the meta-
                                                    skill itself. A non-divergence proposition shows that bounded cap and retirement
                                                    threshold together keep expected performance from drifting below the no-skill
                                                    floor by more than a fixed margin, bounding library drift rather than guaranteeing
                                                    improvement.

                                         1     Introduction
                                         A frozen LLM that solves a hard task today learns nothing that helps it tomorrow. Bridging this
                                         gap without weight updates requires an external memory the same model can consult before its next
                                         attempt. Recent work (3) positions such memories on an experience compression spectrum, from raw
                                         traces (L0 , e.g., Reflexion (4)) through episodic memories (L1 , e.g., MemGPT (5)) and procedural
                                         skills (L2 , e.g., Voyager (1)) to declarative rules (L3 , e.g., RuleShaping (6)), and aggregates a pointed
                                         finding: human-curated skills deliver +16.2pp over a no-skill baseline, while LLM-self-generated
                                         skills deliver +0.0pp (SkillsBench (2)). The bottleneck, across two dozen surveyed systems, is not
                                         the author but the librarian: lifecycle management (versioning, conflict detection, deprecation) is
                                         “largely neglected.” We term this gap library drift: the silent degradation of a skill library’s effective
                                         quality through unchecked growth, redundancy, or premature pruning. Self-evolution is the right
                                         direction, consistent with the bitter lesson (7), but our Proposition 1 (Sec. 3.5) shows that without
                                         a bounded active-cap and a retirement threshold the worst-case performance bound collapses to
                                         vacuous. The question is not whether to self-evolve but what minimal structure makes self-evolution
                                         non-divergent.

Ratchet‡ is a single-agent loop in which a frozen LLM writes, retrieves, curates, and retires its
own natural-language skills, making the librarian explicit via four governance mechanisms. Pattern
canonicalisation collapses near-duplicate critic labels so that two failure descriptions of the same bug
produce one skill, not two. Contribution-score retirement with an evidence floor demotes marginal
skills on measured outcomes, replacing the heuristic update rules of prior systems (1; 8; 9). A
bounded active-cap forces competition for the Router’s shortlist so retrieval does not degrade as
the bank grows. A meta-skill authoring prior constrains the Synthesizer to produce stylistically
consistent skills, implicitly deduplicating without a separate filter. Because skills are synthesised
from failure clusters rather than successes, they are naturally pitfall-oriented, inheriting the guardrails-
beat-guidance effect found for L3 rules (6; 10).
On MBPP+ hard-100 (11) with Claude Opus 4.7, Ratchet lifts 10-round rolling-mean held-out pass@1
from 0.258 ± 0.047 to a late-window 0.584 over 100 rounds (3-seed mean gain +0.328 ± 0.018),
while a forced-no-skill control posts +0.002 ± 0.005.

Contributions

         • Thesis: we reframe SkillsBench’s (2) null result. The bottleneck in self-evolving skill
           libraries is not authoring quality but lifecycle management: retirement, capacity control,
           and authoring guidance. The contribution is this empirical finding and the dissociation
           that supports it, not a new learning algorithm: we hold the author fixed and vary only the
           librarian.
         • Empirical: addressing the librarian bottleneck alone (frozen author, no weight update)
           yields a +0.328 rolling-mean gain on MBPP+ hard-100 and +0.22 peak lift on SWE-bench
           Verified with an agentic solver, to our knowledge the first LLM-self-authored library that
           closes the gap to human-curated performance.
         • Mechanistic: eight ablations identify what “librarian” means concretely. Outcome-driven
           retirement and the meta-skill authoring prior are load-bearing (removing the prior costs
           −0.141; harsh retirement without an evidence floor falls to −0.019, below the no-skill floor);
           explicit deduplication is subsumed by the authoring prior at this scale; frequent meta-skill
           refresh (A8) trades 55% wall-time for marginal gain.
         • Theoretical: a non-divergence bound (Prop. 1) formalises why cap and threshold are the
           minimum governance: expected pass@1 cannot drift below the no-skill floor by more than
           τ + ϵ + Cδ, finite only because both are finite. It bounds drift under stated assumptions
           rather than promising improvement.

Episodic self-correction. Reflexion (4), Self-Refine (12), and ReAct (13) reflect or critique within
a single episode and discard state at the boundary. Ratchet lifts this pattern to cross-task persistence.

Cross-task skill libraries. Voyager (1) pioneered the ever-growing skill library with executable
Minecraft skills; ExpeL (8) extracts textual insights from trajectories but lacks outcome-driven retire-
ment; AutoManual (9) compiles a flat instruction manual per domain. DSPy (14), OPRO (15), and
TextGrad (16) optimise prompts but do not persist per-skill evidence. MemGPT (5) and Generative
Agents (17) manage memory hierarchies but define no typed, retirable skill artifact. Concurrent
2025–2026 work advances the skill-library frontier along orthogonal axes: EvolveR (18) distills
trajectories into strategic principles; Trace2Skill (19) induces skills from trace pools via parallel
sub-agents; CASCADE (20) pairs meta-skills with cumulative skill creation; AutoSkill (21) provides
the closest lifecycle machinery (versioning + standardised schema) but does not retire on measured
per-task contribution; SkillRL (22) couples skill libraries with RL weight updates (a different regime
from frozen-LLM systems); SSL (23) decomposes skills into scheduling, structural, and logical
layers; and Strategy Genes (24) attaches failure history as first-class metadata. A recent survey (3) of
20+ such systems reports that lifecycle management is largely absent; none adopts outcome-driven
retirement paired with a bounded active-cap. Table 1 disaggregates the comparison into eight design
features spanning signal quality, authoring, and governance. It records feature presence as described

by each system’s authors, not relative performance: we do not reimplement these systems on our
split, model, and budget, so the table should be read as a map of which governance axes the literature
covers. Our A1–A8 ablations (Sec. 4.3) isolate what happens when Ratchet itself is stripped of each.

Design-axis parallels between ablations and prior systems. Several of our ablations (Sec. 4.3)
approximate a prior system along one axis: A7 (C = 100) moves toward Voyager’s unbounded
library; A3 (no-meta) removes the authoring-prior that distinguishes Ratchet from AutoManual; A5
(no canonicalisation) reverts toward ExpeL’s free-form labels. These parallels motivate the ablations
but are not claims that any ablation is the prior system; each differs from Ratchet on multiple axes
simultaneously.

Critic reliability and lifecycle. Zheng et al. (26) report >80% agreement between strong LLM
judges and human preferences; we further constrain the Critic to a closed label set and require three
failures sharing a canonical pattern before any skill is born. Weight-update continual learning uses
regularisers like EWC (27); Ratchet avoids weight-update forgetting entirely (weights frozen) and
addresses the skill-space analogue with contribution-score retirement. Recent work (6) shows that
negative constraints outperform positive directives, a reward-shaping effect (10) that Ratchet inherits
by construction, since skills are synthesised from failure clusters. We evaluate on MBPP+ (11), which
extends MBPP (28) with tests that discount spurious passes. The Router resembles a retrieval-and-
rerank pipeline (29); our A2 ablation isolates the LLM-gate contribution from retrieval alone.

Ratchet maintains four core artifact types (full schemas in Appendix C):

        • Skill: a structured YAML artifact with an intent (retrieval surface), a guidance block
          (applies_when, key_insight, common_pitfalls, verify_before_returning), a

         status flag (ACTIVE/DEPRECATED/CANDIDATE), and a Cohere embed-v4 vector over its
         serialised form.
       • Meta-Skill: one per evaluation suite; a Markdown document carrying a schema lock and
         authoring prior consumed by the Synthesizer when writing new skills.
       • Capsule: one per (task, skill, attempt) triple; records pass/fail outcome, model output, and
         round index.
       • Verdict:       one      per failure capsule; carries an   attribution label
         (HELPED/HURT/NEUTRAL/INAPPLICABLE), a short natural-language pattern string,
         and a confidence level.

Capsules and Verdicts form an append-only Evidence Log (SQLite). Skills are never deleted;
retirement changes the status flag and removes the skill from retrieval, but its evidence remains
addressable for future reinstatement.

3.2   The per-round loop

Each round proceeds through five phases (Figure 1):

      1. Eval pass: routes only ACTIVE skills; produces the held-out capsules that the paper reports.
      2. Train pass: runs the same pipeline on the train split (during bootstrap, CANDIDATE skills
         are also routed to accumulate initial evidence); failures become synthesis substrate.
      3. Critic: for every train-failure capsule, an LLM emits a Verdict (attribution + pattern label)
         given the task, skill, solver output, and grader trace.
      4. Synthesizer: reads verdicts from the last W rounds (W = 6) and may author new skills:
            • Pattern canonicalisation: a union-find over pairwise cosine similarity (τcanon = 0.85)
              collapses near-duplicate pattern labels before clustering.
            • Evidence clustering: verdicts are grouped by canonical pattern; clusters with ≥ 3
              members become synthesis targets.
            • Already-covered guard: clusters whose canonical pattern has cosine ≥ 0.85 to an
              existing ACTIVE skill are skipped.

                                                     4

            • Synthesis call: the LLM is prompted with the active meta-skill (schema lock + authoring
              prior) and the cluster’s capsules; output YAML is validated, bank-deduplicated, length-
              capped, and promoted to ACTIVE.
      5. Curator: computes per-skill contribution ĉ(s) := (successes − failures)/trials from the
         evidence log. A skill is retired once n(s) ≥ Nmin trials have accumulated and ĉ(s) ≤ −τ .
         A hard active-cap C forces eviction of the lowest-contribution skill when synthesis would
         exceed the cap.

A Meta-Synth phase runs on a separate, slower cadence to rewrite the meta-skill from recent verdicts;
in the Default it is disabled so the initial meta-skill persists unchanged. All roles are played by the
same frozen LLM via role-specific prompts; durable state resides only in SQLite.

3.3   The Router

Given a task and the ACTIVE skill set, the Router selects one skill or NONE. When the bank is small
(|ACTIVE| ≤ 20) the LLM sees every skill and makes a binary choice. When the bank is larger, a
two-stage retrieval (tf-idf top-K ∪ embedding top-K, K = 10) produces a shortlist that the LLM then
adjudicates.

3.4   Rollback with a persistence gate

A round whose held-out pass@1 falls by more than τrb = 0.10 below the running best is flagged as a
regression. Rollback fires only after five consecutive regressions, preventing a single noisy round
from triggering a restore. On rollback, the skill-bank snapshot from the best round is reinstated and
the regressed state is archived for audit.
Rollback therefore reads the same stream the paper reports, which is deliberate: Ratchet targets online
lifecycle management, where the only signal a deployed agent has is outcomes on live traffic, and a
frozen held-back split that no deployment possesses would measure a different and easier problem.
Two design properties keep this from inflating the reported gains: the headline metric is a within-run
window average that round selection cannot inflate rather than the peak (Sec. 4.1), and the gate is
a circuit-breaker that can only restore an earlier bank after a sustained regression, never select a
favourable round. Sec. 4.5 measures how often it fires in practice.

3.5   Non-divergence under bounded cap and threshold retirement

Prior systems (1; 8; 9) provide no guarantee that performance on a fixed task distribution cannot
degrade over time. Ratchet’s bounded active-cap C and retirement threshold τ yield a simple non-
divergence property: the argument establishes a floor (not a convergence rate) but rules out unbounded
library growth as a failure mode.
Let St ⊆ S denote the ACTIVE skill set at the start of round t, with |St | ≤ C by construction.
For a task x drawn from a fixed distribution D, let p0 (x) ∈ [0, 1] be the pass probability of the
base LLM with no skill injected (the NONE route) and let p(x | s) be the pass probability when
skill s is injected. Define the per-skill contribution c(s) := Ex∼D [p(x | s) − p0 (x)]. Our Curator
retires skill s once n(s) ≥ Nmin trials have been accumulated and ĉ(s) ≤ −τ , where ĉ(s) :=
(successes − failures)/trials is the empirical score computed over the tasks the Router actually sent
to s. We are explicit about what this score is and is not: it measures s’s outcome balance on its
routed subpopulation, and it coincides with the full-distribution contrast c(s) only when routing is
non-selective with respect to p0 , since no counterfactual no-skill attempt is run on the same routed
tasks. Treating ĉ as an estimator of c is therefore an assumption of the analysis below, stated as (ii),
rather than a property we establish.
Proposition 1 (Non-divergence in expectation). Assume (i) the Router is retrieval-consistent:
conditional on a task x, it selects either NONE or some s ∈ St , and injecting NONE produces p0 (x);
(ii) ĉ is an unbiased consistent estimator of c; (iii) Nmin is chosen so that with probability at least
1 − δ, |ĉ(s) − c(s)| ≤ ϵ for every ACTIVE skill after Nmin trials (a Hoeffding bound). Then the
expected eval pass@1 under Ratchet is lower-bounded by E[p0 ] − (τ + ϵ) − C δ. In words: the
population-level pass rate cannot drift below the no-skill floor by more than a fixed margin that
depends only on the retirement threshold, the estimation tolerance, and the active-cap.

the observed ±0.05 spread is within expected sampling noise. The rolling gain is computed within
each run, cancelling this baseline variation. A1–A8 each adjust one knob from the Default.

Proof sketch. With probability at least 1 − Cδ (union bound over |St | ≤ C skills), every surviving
skill has c(s) ≥ ĉ(s) − ϵ ≥ −τ − ϵ. On the high-probability event, any task routed to a surviving
skill has expected pass probability at least p0 (x) − τ − ϵ; tasks routed to NONE have expected pass
probability p0 (x). Taking expectations over D gives the stated bound.
                                                                                                   −3
Numerical instantiation. With our Default p values τ = 0.10, Nmin = 100, C = 50, and δ = 10
per skill, the Hoeffding bound gives ϵ = ln(2/δ)/(2Nmin ) ≈ 0.20 and Cδ = 0.05, so the floor is
E[p0 ] − 0.35. The margin is finite only because C and τ are, which is the point of the exercise: with
an unbounded cap and no retirement threshold (1; 8; 9) there is no finite analogue at any baseline. It
is also loose, and how loose depends on the baseline: at our E[p0 ] ≈ 0.26 the floor falls below zero
and so says nothing, whereas a baseline near the 0.65 of our SWE-bench setting places it at 0.30. The
proposition should therefore be read as bounding how far library drift can go under its assumptions,
not as predicting performance; the empirical +0.328 gain (Sec. 4.2) sits far above the floor.

4     Experiments

4.1   Protocol

We evaluate on MBPP+ hard-100, a 100-task subset of MBPP+ (60 train / 40 held-out eval) selected
for genuine difficulty under Claude Opus 4.7 (construction in Appendix B). The split is fixed across
all conditions so round-0 scores are directly comparable. All LLM calls use Claude Opus 4.7; all
embeddings use Cohere embed-v4 (both via Amazon Bedrock). The Solver is a single direct LLM
call with no execution feedback, no self-refinement, and no tool use, isolating the skill library’s
contribution from inference-time scaffolding. Each run is 100 rounds; we report mean ± std across 3
seeds (s = 42, 7, 13). Full hyperparameters are in Appendix A.

Metric. We report the rolling gain: mean(last 10 rounds) − mean(first 10 rounds) of held-out
pass@1, plus the peak over all 100 rounds.

4.2   Main result

Table 2 and Fig. 2 summarise the results. The Default is the configuration of Sec. 3, with all
four hygiene mechanisms enabled at the settings the non-divergence analysis motivates. It gains
+0.328 ± 0.018 and peaks at 0.658 ± 0.042, more than doubling round-0 held-out pass@1, while the
no-skill control (A1) stays at 0.25–0.30 across all seeds. The gain is therefore attributable to the skill
library rather than to round-to-round drift in the graded subset.

(no skill injection) is the flat floor; A2 (retrieval-only) and A3 (no meta-skill) show partial gains; A4
(harsh retirement) is harmful. A5–A6 (relaxed dedup) and A8 (meta-synth refresh) slightly exceed
the Default; A7 (doubled cap) is comparable with higher variance. A8’s gain comes at 55% more
wall time (Table 6).

4.3                     Ablations: which hygiene mechanisms carry the load

Eight adjustments (A1–A8) each modify one knob of the Default to test whether the corresponding
design choice is load-bearing (3 seeds per condition; full settings in Table 3). They are built to isolate
which mechanism carries the load inside Ratchet, not to reproduce prior systems on our split, model,
and budget; where an ablation resembles a prior design we note the parallel but make no claim that it
instantiates that system, and we do not read the sweep as evidence that the Default is Pareto-optimal.
We group them into two questions: which components are necessary? (A1–A3) and how sensitive
are the governance knobs? (A4–A8).

A1–A3: which components are necessary? A1 (no skill injection) forces the Router to NONE,
establishing the floor. A2 (retrieval-only) bypasses the LLM gate and injects the top-ranked retrieval
hit. A3 (no meta-skill) removes the meta-skill from the Synthesizer prompt. Each measures the cost
of removing one component from the Default (+0.328). Removing skill injection (A1) eliminates
essentially the whole gain (+0.002, the floor): synthesis and curation continue, so what is lost is the
act of putting skills in front of the Solver. Bypassing the LLM gate (A2) retains only +0.077, so most
of the lift comes from deciding whether a retrieved skill applies rather than from retrieval ranking
alone. Removing the meta-skill (A3) retains +0.187, a cost of −0.141, which makes the authoring
prior the most valuable of the three components that are merely helpful rather than indispensable.

A4–A8: how sensitive are the governance knobs? A4 (harsh retirement) lowers Nmin to 20
and tightens τ to 0.0. A5 (no canonicalisation) raises τcanon to 1.0. A6 (no cover-guard) disables
duplicate-cluster skipping. A7 (bank cap=100) doubles the active-cap. A8 (meta-synth refresh)
regenerates the meta-skill every 10 rounds.

A4: harsh retirement is harmful. A4 posts −0.019 ±p          0.010, worse than the no-skill floor. At
                        −3
Nmin = 20 and δ = 10 , the Hoeffding deviation is ϵ = ln(2/δ)/(2 · 20) ≈ 0.44; with τ = 0.0,
any skill whose true contribution c ∈ [−0.44, 0] can be retired on unlucky early draws. In contrast,
the Default (Nmin = 100, τ = 0.10) has ϵ ≈ 0.20, so skills with c ≥ −0.10 survive in expectation.
This validates the evidence-floor argument in Prop. 1: the retirement threshold is insufficient without
a sufficiently large evidence floor.

                                                                                7

A5–A7: dedup is not necessary at this scale. A5 (+0.374 ± 0.023) and A6 (+0.363 ± 0.033)
both exceed the Default (+0.328 ± 0.018) by ∼0.04, within ±2σ overlap at n = 3 seeds. We interpret
this conservatively: canonicalisation and the cover-guard are not necessary given the meta-skill’s
authoring guidance on a 100-task suite, rather than strictly harmful; Sec. 5 discusses why the prior
and the filter act as substitutes. A7 (+0.317 ± 0.110) shows comparable mean gain but substantially
higher variance; with 3 seeds we cannot distinguish whether the cap is load-bearing in mean or
primarily controls variance, though the evidence is consistent with a cap that rarely binds at this bank
size.

A8: meta-synth refresh adds cost for marginal gain. A8 refreshes the meta-skill every 10 rounds
(vs. the Default’s fixed meta-skill). It achieves +0.372 ± 0.017 rolling gain and the highest peak
(0.725), slightly exceeding the Default within noise. However, it synthesises 24% more skills (188
vs. 152) and takes 55% longer wall time (10.1 h vs. 6.5 h), with LLM calls comparable (+125,
<1%). The extra synthesis rounds are dominated by the curate phase (27% vs. 23% of wall time).
Conclusion: more frequent refresh does not meaningfully improve the learning curve but incurs
substantial compute overhead.

Synthesis. Read together, A1–A8 separate the recipe into three tiers. Injection and the authoring
prior are load-bearing: removing either forfeits most or all of the gain (A1, A3). Retirement is
load-bearing only when paired with a sufficient evidence floor, and is worse than useless without
one (A4). The remaining governance is not necessary at this scale: explicit deduplication (A5, A6)
is subsumed by the authoring prior, doubling the cap changes the mean little (A7), and frequent
meta-skill refresh buys wall time rather than accuracy (A8). Two of the three surprises here run
against our own design: we built explicit dedup expecting it to help, and we expected harsh retirement
to underperform rather than to fall below the no-skill floor. The minimal recipe our evidence supports
is thus injection, an authoring prior, and threshold retirement with an evidence floor, with the rest
reserved for scales where the prior stops sufficing (Sec. 5).

4.4   Skill library dynamics

Over 100 rounds the Default synthesises ∼152 candidate skills; 89 are deprecated by the curator and
50 remain ACTIVE at the cap. The Router engages a skill on ∼73% of eval tasks, confirming that the
bank is used rather than merely accumulated. Full per-condition operational metrics (wall time, LLM
calls, router engagement, bank turnover) are in Appendix F.

4.5   How often the rollback gate fires

Because the persistence gate (Sec. 3.4) reads the same held-out stream we report, we audit its actual
influence on the three Default seeds. It fired twice in total: once each for seeds 42 and 13, never for
seed 7, out of 300 round-decisions. Both firings arrested a sustained multi-round regression rather
than reaching forward for a favourable round. On seed 42, held-out pass@1 sat at 0.525–0.550 for
five consecutive rounds after peaking at 0.675; the gate restored the round-62 bank and subsequent
rounds recovered to 0.625–0.650. Seed 13 followed the same pattern. Two interventions across
300 decisions cannot account for a +0.328 rolling gain, and the rolling metric averages a ten-round
window rather than selecting a round, so the gate prevents degradation without manufacturing the
reported gain. The gate is also the only path by which held-out outcomes reach the loop: the train
and held-out sets are disjoint by construction (60 and 40 tasks, no overlap), so no held-out task is
ever solved, critiqued, or synthesised from.

4.6   Generality: agentic solvers on SWE-bench

To test whether Ratchet transfers beyond single-call code generation, we run the Default configura-
tion’s full per-round loop (Router, Solver, Critic, Synthesizer, Curator) unchanged on a 150-task hard
subset of SWE-bench Verified (30), selected analogously to the MBPP+ subset (tasks not solved on
every baseline seed, stratified by difficulty and balanced across 10 repositories; details in Appendix B).
The only substitution is the Solver: an agentic Claude Code§ session that can browse files, run tests,
and iterate, with skills injected as a CLAUDE.md preamble read at session startup. We run 20 rounds
  § https://www.anthropic.com/product/claude-code

                                                    8

rather than 100 because each agentic session averages ∼5 min per task, so one round over 150 tasks
takes ∼50 min wall-clock at parallelism 16.
Across three seeds, the no-skill baseline (round 0) achieves a mean held-out pass@1 of 0.65, and
after skill injection the mean peaks at 0.87 (best seed 0.92; per-seed breakdown in Table 5): a
+0.22 peak lift, against +0.40 for the MBPP+ Default under the same peak-minus-round-0 reading
(0.258 → 0.658). The baseline is high because the hard-150 filter retains tasks the no-skill agent
fails on at least one of five probe seeds (independent of the three experiment seeds), not tasks it fails
consistently, and Claude Code is a strong agent: 0.65 reflects the seed-to-seed variance the filter
targets, tasks solved some of the time but not reliably, rather than an absence of difficulty. That
is precisely what skills should address, supplying consistent guidance to move a solve rate from
“sometimes” to “reliably”.
We read this run as a pilot rather than a second headline result. 20 rounds is too short for a stable
late-window mean, so only the peak is available, and a peak-only figure does not support a gain
estimate comparable to the MBPP+ one. The evidence it does provide is that the recipe carries over
to multi-step, tool-using agents with no architecture change.

5    Discussion

The meta-skill as implicit deduplication. Removing the meta-skill (A3) costs −0.141 of the
Default’s gain, while removing the explicit canonicalisation filter (A5) or cover-guard (A6) does not
hurt, and may slightly help. One mechanism explains both: the authoring prior enforces stylistic
homogeneity across generated skills, which is what makes cosine similarity a reliable duplicate signal
in the first place, so the explicit filter adds little beyond its own false positives, which discard useful
skills. Canonicalisation and the meta-skill are therefore substitutes rather than complements at this
scale, a design consideration for any system that pairs LLM-authored artifacts with embedding-based
retrieval.

Evidence over self-report. Skills are born from externally-diagnosed failure clusters, not from
the model’s self-assessment that a skill would help. Separating diagnosis (Critic) from generation
(Synthesizer) is what makes the evidence log trustworthy and retirement auditable.

Scale-dependence of hygiene knobs. Which mechanisms are load-bearing is a property of the
scale they operate at, not of the recipe alone. Our conclusion that explicit deduplication is dispensable
rests on a 100-task suite whose bank saturates at 50 skills, where one authoring prior can cover the
failure modes the Critic labels. On larger or more diverse suites, with hundreds of candidate patterns
and no single prior able to constrain them all, we expect the false positives that make the filter a
liability here to be outweighed by the duplicates it catches. The same reasoning applies to the active
cap, which A7 suggests rarely binds at 50 skills and would bind sooner as the pattern space grows. We
therefore offer the Default as a safe starting point rather than a tuned optimum: its knobs, particularly
τcanon and the cover threshold, are the ones to revisit once the bank outgrows what a single prior can
govern. What does not depend on scale is the non-divergence property (Prop. 1), which holds for any
task distribution and any bank size whenever the cap and the retirement threshold are finite.

Limitations

Amplifier, not discoverer. Weights are frozen; Ratchet redirects existing capabilities but cannot
teach genuinely new knowledge. We expect pass@k to be unchanged; future work should confirm.

Scope. (i) The SWE-bench result is a pilot (20 rounds, peak-only). (ii) Single model and provider.
Ratchet’s mechanisms act on the evidence log rather than on model internals, and the only model-
dependent assumption (that the base model authors occasionally-useful skills and self-critiques better
than chance) is a floor that rises with capability, so we expect the recipe to transfer. Cross-family
stability is nonetheless untested, and we make no cross-model generality claim here. (iii) Critic noise
can crystallise into persistent skills; mitigated via a closed label set but lacking principled calibration.
(iv) Retirement measures an outcome contrast on routed tasks, so it identifies correlation rather than
causation, and reads the routed subpopulation rather than the full task distribution (Sec. 3.5).

                                                     9

Ethics and safety. Closed benchmark, deterministic grading, no user data. The only artifacts are
natural-language skills.

6    Conclusion
The bottleneck in self-evolving LLM skill libraries is not the author; it is the librarian. Ratchet
demonstrates this by holding the author fixed (a frozen LLM, no weight update) and varying only
the lifecycle management: outcome-driven retirement, a bounded active-cap, and an authoring prior
that implicitly deduplicates. This minimal prescription more than doubles held-out pass@1 on
genuinely difficult tasks (+0.328 on MBPP+), whereas the same author with no librarian gains
nothing (+0.002), and it transfers unchanged to an agentic solver on SWE-bench Verified (+0.22
peak lift, a 20-round pilot). Eight ablations decompose what “librarian” means, and the decomposition
is smaller than our design anticipated: injection, an authoring prior, and threshold retirement with
an evidence floor carry the result, while explicit deduplication is subsumed by the prior at this scale.
The non-divergence property that motivates the cap and the threshold is scale-free, finite whenever
both are finite, and bounds drift rather than promising improvement. All hyperparameters, prompts,
and subset construction details are reported for end-to-end reproducibility.

A    Hyperparameters and runtime configuration
Each ablation (A1–A8) overrides exactly the knob named after it and holds everything else at the
values in Table 3. Full defaults are in the released codebase (Appendix G).

Table 3: Key Default-configuration hyperparameters. Omitted knobs (retry budgets, solver-cache
flags, logging cadence) use the released codebase’s defaults and do not affect the reported results.

Temperature.       All LLM calls use T = 1.0 (API-enforced for Claude Opus 4.7).

Compute. Each run is 100 rounds on the hard-100 subset; wall-time per run is 2–10 h depending
on condition (Table 6). A1 (no injection) is cheapest (2.3 h) because skills never inject. A8 (meta-
synth-refresh) is most expensive (10.1 h) because the frequent meta-skill refresh triggers additional
synthesis rounds. The Default runs in 6.5 h (∼14.5k LLM calls, of which 69% are the solver). Our
ablation sweep (A1–A8) × 3 seeds launches three child processes per ablation in parallel; total
wall-time for the sweep is dominated by the slowest seed within each group.

B    Subset construction
MBPP+ hard-100. MBPP+ (11) extends the 378-task MBPP+ test split with additional unit tests
that discount spurious passes. We construct hard-100 by the following procedure:

      1. For every task in the 378-task split, run Claude Opus 4.7 under a no-skill baseline across 5
         probe seeds (independent of the 3 experiment seeds), recording each seed’s pass/fail.
      2. Discard tasks the baseline solves on all 5 seeds (∼ 273 tasks), since a skill library cannot
         possibly improve on an already-saturated task. Retain the remainder (those that fail at least
         once); these are the tasks where a skill library could plausibly help.
      3. Randomly sample 100 tasks from the retained pool (fixed random seed for reproducibility);
         split 60/40 into train and eval subsets.

The resulting subset is 100 tasks (60 train, 40 eval) and is consumed verbatim by every run in
this paper. Reporting on a fixed hard subset lets round-0 capsules be directly comparable across
conditions; reporting on the full MBPP+ split would inflate the baseline (most tasks are already
solved by the base LLM) and obscure the per-round learning signal.

                                                     12

SWE-bench Verified hard-150. SWE-bench Verified (30) contains 500 human-validated issue–
patch pairs. We construct hard-150 analogously:

      1. Run the Claude Code agent (no skills) on all 500 tasks across 5 probe seeds (independent of
         the 3 experiment seeds); discard tasks solved on every seed.
      2. From the retained pool, sample 150 tasks stratified by repository (10 repos) and difficulty,
         using a fixed random seed; split 90/60 into train and eval subsets.

C    Skill and meta-skill schemas
A skill is a dataclass with the following fields:

id:          str                         #   snake_case, LLM-proposed
name:        str                         #   short human label
version:     str                         #   incremented on resynth
intent:      str                         #   canonical query-match surface
description: str                         #   one-line role of the skill
signals_match: list[str]                 #   retrieval-time lexical cues
preconditions: list[str]                 #   applicability conditions
tags:        list[str]                   #   domain tags
guidance:    Guidance                    #   structured injection (below)
status:      SkillStatus                 #   ACTIVE | DEPRECATED | CANDIDATE
embedding:   list[float]                 #   Cohere embed-v4 over full YAML
created_at: timestamp
updated_at: timestamp

The Guidance sub-dataclass is what the Solver actually sees when the skill is selected:

applies_when:           str                         #   when the skill applies
key_insight:            str                         #   what to keep in mind
common_pitfalls:        list[str]                   #   failure modes to avoid
verify_before_returning: str                        #   post-condition check

The common_pitfalls list is what concretely realises the pitfall-oriented framing introduced in
Sec. 1: because each skill is synthesised from a cluster of failure patterns labelled by the Critic, the
pitfalls are populated with the specific error modes the cluster exhibits, and the other Guidance
fields read as “to avoid pitfall P on tasks where X, do Y and verify Z” rather than as unconditional
directives.
A meta-skill is a Markdown document (.md) with a small YAML frontmatter block followed by “##
Do” and “## Don’t” sections, carrying a schema lock (the field names a valid skill must have) and an
authoring prior (stylistic guidance for the Synthesizer). At most one meta-skill per suite is ACTIVE
at any time; creating a new one retires the prior. The default MBPP+ meta-skill, shipped ACTIVE at
round 0 of every run (and left untouched through all 100 rounds in the Default; A8 refreshes it every
10 rounds). The template structure is:

---
id: default_mbpp
description: Authoring guidance for MBPP+ pattern-level skills.
suite: mbpp
status: active
---
## Scope
<one sentence describing the task domain>

## Do
- <field_name>: <what to write and a concrete example>
  ... (one bullet per Guidance field)

                                                    13

## Don’t
- <anti-pattern to avoid>
  ... (3-5 bullets)

For example, the MBPP+ meta-skill’s ## Do section specifies that signals_match should contain 2–
4 pattern words (e.g. sliding_window, two_pointer), that common_pitfalls must cite observed
failure modes from the trace, and that verify_before_returning must name a concrete post-
check. The ## Don’t section prohibits vague guidance, third-party libraries, and multi-pattern
skills.
The A3 ablation (no-meta) removes this document from the Synthesizer’s prompt. Its effect on the
learning curve (−0.141 rolling-mean gain relative to the Default) is the direct measurement of what
the authoring prior contributes.

D    Prompt templates
We reproduce the load-bearing prompt templates below. Full versions (including retry-repair variants)
are in the released codebase (Appendix G).

Critic verdict prompt. Given a failed Capsule (task, skill if any, solver output, grader output), the
Critic is asked to emit one Verdict:

SYSTEM: You are a Critic. Given a task, the skill the Router
chose (if any), the solver’s code, and the grader’s verdict,
judge whether the skill helped, hurt, was neutral, or was
inapplicable, and label the failure by pattern.

OUTPUT: YAML with fields:
  attribution: HELPED | HURT | NEUTRAL | INAPPLICABLE
  pattern:     short string — what kind of failure is this?
  confidence: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
  reason:      one sentence justifying the attribution

Synthesizer skill prompt. Given a cluster of failure Capsules sharing a canonical pattern, the
Synthesizer authors one skill YAML:

SYSTEM: You author one skill YAML that would help the Solver
avoid the failure pattern in this cluster. The authoring
guidance below is the current meta-skill.

AUTHORING GUIDANCE: {authoring_guidance}

CLUSTER: {capsule_summary}

ACTIVE BANK (do not duplicate): {active_bank}

OUTPUT: YAML skill under {char_budget} characters. The ‘guidance‘
field is a mapping of applies_when, key_insight, common_pitfalls,
verify_before_returning; populate at least applies_when plus one
of key_insight / common_pitfalls.

In the A3 ablation (–no-meta-injection), authoring_guidance is forced to the empty string.

E    Per-seed results
Table 2 in the main text reports mean±std over 3 seeds for MBPP+ hard-100. Table 4 here gives the
per-seed breakdown for all conditions.
Table 5 gives the per-seed breakdown for the SWE-bench Verified experiment (Section 4.6).

F    Operational cost and skill dynamics (MBPP+)

Table 6 reports wall-clock time, LLM call counts, router engagement, and skill-bank turnover for
each MBPP+ condition, averaged over 3 seeds. All runs use 100 rounds on the hard-100 subset (60
train + 40 eval tasks per round). Wall-clock times depend on API throughput and concurrency at
measurement time; LLM call counts are the provider-independent cost metric.

Key observations. (1) The solver dominates LLM calls in all conditions (63–99%); the skill-
management overhead (critic + synth) is at most 37% of total calls. (2) A1 still synthesises 94 skills
because the full pipeline (critic, synthesizer, curator) runs normally; only the Router is forced to
NONE , so skills are never injected into the solver. This isolates the routing effect: A1’s flat learning
curve shows that skill creation alone, without injection, produces no gain. The 0 critic calls confirm
no train capsule triggers a verdict (since no skill is ever routed). (3) A2 has the highest LLM cost
(15 910) because retrieval-only routing always injects a skill, triggering a critic verdict on every train
task. (4) A4 reaches only 2 active skills: harsh retirement empties the bank, explaining its negative

Table 6: Operational metrics per condition (mean over 3 seeds). LLM total = solver (10 000, constant)
+ critic (1 per routed train capsule) + synth (1 per skill born). Rtr % (Router %) = fraction of eval
tasks where a skill was injected. Born = skills synthesised by the LLM; Retired/Active = bank state at
round 100. Born > Active + Retired when the curator’s dedup or cover-guard filters reject candidates
before bank entry (e.g. A5 disables canonicalisation so nothing is filtered: Born = Active + Retired).
