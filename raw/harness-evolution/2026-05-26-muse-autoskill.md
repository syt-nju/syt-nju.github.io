                                                        Large language model (LLM) agents rely on reusable skills to solve complex tasks, but existing
                                                        skill creation approaches often treat skills as isolated, static artifacts, limiting reusability, relia-
                                                        bility, and long-term improvement. We propose MUSE-Autoskill Agent (Memory-Utilizing Skill
                                                        Evolution), a skill-centric agent framework that creates, reuses, and refines skills under a uni-
                                                        fied lifecycle: creation, memory, management, evaluation, and refinement. MUSE creates skills
                                                        on demand, stores them across tasks, retrieves them through a skill catalog, and accumulates
                                                        per-skill experience for later reuse and adaptation. Across the main reported settings on Skills-
                                                        Bench and SkillLearnBench, MUSE-Autoskill outperforms Hermes, Codex, and Claude Code. On
                                                        SkillsBench, its self-created skills surpass human-authored skills on the successfully covered sub-
                                                        set (85.24% vs. 81.17%), showing that lifecycle-managed skills can distill agent experience into
                                                        highly effective reusable assets; MUSE-created skills also transfer to Hermes more effectively than
                                                        Codex- or Claude-created skills, reaching 51.90% accuracy under transfer. These results highlight
                                                        the importance of treating skills as long-lived, experience-aware, and testable assets.

1   Introduction
Skills for agents. Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly tasked with solving complex, real-
world problems that involve interacting with external tools, data, and code, often spanning many steps and
disparate domains [8, 17, 37]. As task scope grows, raw model reasoning alone is insufficient: agents need
access to reusable units of capability, namely skills, that encapsulate procedures, executable code, or domain-
specific instructions and can be composed into solutions [2, 28]. Skills are emerging as the natural abstraction
for scalable agent systems because they decouple capability from monolithic model weights, enabling modular
execution and the accumulation of structured domain knowledge [2, 33]. The central open question is how to
enable agents to continuously improve their capabilities through skills they can obtain, organize, and refine
on their own, without relying on human authoring at every step.

Limits of AutoSkill. A growing line of work uses LLMs to synthesize skills automatically, starting from
Voyager’s executable code library in Minecraft [28] and extending to general-purpose agents via AutoSkill [36],
EvoSkill [1], and SkillGen [15]. More recent approaches use reinforcement learning to jointly optimize skill
selection, use, and distillation (Skill1 [25]) or to train a dedicated skill curator (SkillOS [18]). On the
production side, Anthropic’s Agent Skills [2] standardize skills as portable folders of instructions and scripts.
While these methods successfully expand agent functionality, they typically cover only part of the skill lifecycle
and leave four practical gaps: (i) a creation–usage mismatch, where skills are produced without access to
the agent’s runtime context; (ii) no structured per-skill memory that accumulates free-form experience about
individual skills across tasks; (iii) static, unvalidated skills without unit-test-driven evaluation or refinement;
and (iv) poor context handling, where flat conversation histories truncate or overflow on long-horizon tasks.

Skill lifecycle. We argue that skills should not be one-off generation outputs but long-lived, evolving assets
of an agent system. A useful skill is created on demand within the agent’s reasoning loop, stored with
associated experience and metadata [19, 20, 27], retrieved when contextually relevant, validated through
tests and runtime feedback, and continuously refined as new evidence accumulates [3, 15, 16]. We formalize
this perspective as a unified skill lifecycle with five stages: creation, memory, management, evaluation, and
refinement. This reframing turns skills from disposable artifacts into managed, testable, and transferable
infrastructure: the foundation needed for agents to accumulate experience across tasks, sessions, and even
across different agent systems.

MUSE-Autoskill framework. We instantiate this lifecycle in MUSE-Autoskill Agent (Memory-Utilizing Skill
Evolution; Figure 2). MUSE tightly couples skill creation with execution through a built-in skill_create tool
invoked from within the runtime loop, eliminating the creation–usage mismatch. It introduces a multi-level
memory comprising short-term, long-term, and (uniquely) skill-level memory, which accumulates per-skill
experience across tasks and informs future invocations. An evaluation subsystem grounds reliability in unit
tests and execution feedback, automatically triggering refinement when tests fail. A structured context
manager with adaptive compression and cross-session state persistence supports long-horizon tasks without
information loss or context-window blowup. Together, these components make skills externalized, testable,
and transferable, rather than internal model behavior locked inside opaque weights.

Results. Figure 1 previews our headline results on SkillsBench, a benchmark of real-world tasks graded
by automated verifiers in standardized Docker environments. On the 75-task common set, MUSE-Autoskill
achieves the best no-skill accuracy (46.95%) and the best human-skill accuracy (59.67%, a +12.72 pp lift).
Human skills improve all four GPT-5.5-backed agents by +10.78 to +13.73 pp. Self-created skills also improve
every skill-creating agent on the same all-task denominator: MUSE-Autoskill reaches 53.42%, above Codex
(47.52%) and Claude Code (44.27%). A stability analysis in Appendix K further shows that MUSE-Autoskill-
created skills have the lowest run-to-run reward dispersion among the compared self-created-skill conditions.
Generated skills transfer across agent runtimes: Hermes reaches 51.90% with MUSE-Autoskill-created skills,
exceeding Hermes with human skills at 48.02%. We further evaluate on SkillLearnBench, a separate 20-
task, 100-instance benchmark for continual skill generation, where MUSE-Autoskill also obtains the best
human-skill accuracy (72.0%) and self-created-skill accuracy (48.0%).

Contributions. This paper makes four contributions:

• Skill lifecycle. We reframe skills from one-off generation outputs into long-lived, lifecycle-managed assets,
  identifying five stages (creation, memory, management, evaluation, refinement) that any practical skill-
  centric agent system must address.

• MUSE-Autoskill. A skill-centric agent that improves its task-solving capability over time by integrating skill
  creation with runtime execution, evaluating code-backed skills with unit tests and using sandbox/runtime
  feedback for all generated skills.
• Infrastructure. Multi-level memory with a novel skill-level memory that accumulates per-skill experience
  across tasks; adaptive context compression with cross-session state persistence; and cross-agent skill transfer
  that makes generated skills usable beyond their authoring agent.
• Validation. Best-in-class SkillsBench accuracy among four GPT-5.5-backed agents on the 75-task common
  set (59.67% with human skills, +12.72 pp lift); strongest self-created skill result under all-task scoring
  (53.42%); generated skills that transfer to Hermes above its human-skill score; and corroborating Skill-
  LearnBench results on 100 verified instances.

2      Related Work
2.1     LLM Agents
LLM-based agents that interact with tools, environments, and data have advanced rapidly in recent years [5, 6,
23, 31]. Building on ReAct [37]’s interleaving of reasoning and action, follow-up systems extend the paradigm
to broader workflows, including multimodal autonomous agents such as Agent-Omni [11], MUSE [14], and
OmniGAIA [10], and a wider body of work on self-improving agents [16, 27]. A parallel line of work focuses
on equipping agents with tool-use capabilities, ranging from few-shot tool calling [22] to tool orchestration
via model selection [24] and large-scale API retrieval [21]; for software engineering specifically, agents such as
CodeAgent [38], SWE-Agent [34], and OpenHands [29] drive tool-integrated workflows over sandboxed shells
and editors to resolve real-world repository tasks. The capabilities of such systems are now measured by
general agent benchmarks including GAIA [17], SWE-bench [8], and AgentBench [13], which together cover
web browsing, real-world software engineering, and multi-environment tool use. Despite this progress, most
agent frameworks treat the set of available actions as either a fixed, hand-engineered tool registry or a flat


                                                                           3
conversational scratchpad. They do not natively support agents that can author, validate, and accumulate
their own reusable capabilities over time, which is precisely the gap the skill-centric literature, and our
framework, set out to close.

2.2   Automatic Skill Systems
We organize the growing literature on automatic skill systems along two axes: which stages of the skill lifecycle
(creation, memory, management, evaluation, refinement) a method addresses, and whether it operates entirely
at inference time or requires additional model training. Table 1 summarizes the resulting comparison along
these two axes.
The first major direction builds skill systems on top of pretrained LLMs without any fine-tuning. Voyager [28]
is the seminal example: in the Minecraft setting, it maintains an ever-growing library of executable-code skills,
with self-verification and iterative prompting that lets the same LLM both author and refine skills in response
to environment feedback. Follow-up work generalizes this paradigm to general-purpose agents: AutoSkill [36]
derives, maintains, and reuses skills from dialogue and interaction traces as a model-agnostic plugin layer;
EvoSkill [1] analyses execution failures and proposes new skills or edits, retaining only those that improve
held-out validation under a Pareto-frontier selection; and SkillGen [15] iteratively refines skills via contrastive
induction over successful and failed trajectories, modelling each skill as an intervention to empirically verify its
net effect. The feedback-driven refinement underlying these methods is rooted in a broader self-improvement
literature outside the skill setting: Reflexion [27] maintains reflective text in an episodic memory buffer across
attempts, Self-Refine [16] iteratively rewrites outputs using self-generated critiques, Self-Debug [3] closes the
loop on code generation with execution and unit-test traces, and ExpeL [39] extracts natural-language insights
across training tasks for inference-time reuse. These methods all improve agent behavior through linguistic
feedback but stop short of treating skills as first-class, externalized, testable artifacts that outlive a single
task or agent. On the industrial side, Anthropic’s Agent Skills [2] standardize skills as portable folders of
SKILL.md instructions and scripts loaded via progressive disclosure; this is the closest practical analogue of our
externalized skill format, but the system leaves evaluation and refinement to human authoring. Collectively,
these training-free methods are lightweight and naturally portable across LLM backbones, yet each covers only
part of the lifecycle: none simultaneously supports structured per-skill memory, unit-test-driven evaluation,
and automatic refinement triggered by test feedback.
A second, concurrent direction uses reinforcement learning to optimize skill behavior jointly with the pol-
icy. SkillMaster [35] learns a single policy that both acts and edits its skill bank, with edits credited by
counterfactual downstream utility. Skill1 [25] frames skill evolution as a unified RL problem, co-optimizing
skill selection, utilization, and distillation under a shared task-outcome reward. SkillOS [18] pairs a frozen
executor with a trainable curator that updates an external skill repository from accumulated experience, and
shows that the curator generalizes across executor backbones; this is a portability axis complementary to
ours, where the skills themselves rather than the curator are the unit of transfer. Youtu-Agent [26] pursues a
related direction via hybrid policy optimization of tools and agent configurations. These RL-based methods
can attain strong optimality on the environments they are trained on, but they couple skill behavior to
a trained policy or curator: migrating to a new backbone typically requires additional training, and skills
produced by one trained policy are not directly usable by a different agent without re-training.

2.3   Benchmarks and Positioning
Several recent benchmarks complement the methods above by stressing different lifecycle stages. Skills-
Bench [9], which we adopt in our experiments, measures end-to-end task accuracy with and without skills
across diverse Docker-evaluated real-world tasks. SkillRet [4] isolates the management stage by evaluating
skill retrieval at scale from a library of nearly 18,000 community-contributed skills. SkillLearnBench [41]
and LifelongAgentBench [40] focus on continual and lifelong skill acquisition over task streams, and notably
report that strong individual methods do not consistently dominate, motivating system-level designs such
as ours. A concurrent survey [33] catalogues skill-acquisition modalities and architectural choices for LLM
agents, situating both training-free and training-based directions within a broader taxonomy.
Compared with the methods above, MUSE-Autoskill differs in that it brings all five lifecycle stages together

within a single training-free framework, rather than addressing creation or refinement in isolation. In partic-
ular, it introduces skill-level memory that accumulates per-skill experience across tasks, uses unit-test-driven
evaluation that automatically triggers refinement when tests fail, and is the only general-purpose method to
empirically validate cross-agent skill transfer by injecting its generated skills into a different agent without
modification (Section 4); other portability claims in the literature are limited to swapping the underlying
LLM backbone or sharing skills across product variants of the same agent family, without an explicit cross-
agent experiment. The combination of full lifecycle coverage and a training-free design also makes the system
portable across LLMs and agent architectures, as summarized in the bottom row of Table 1.

3     MUSE-Autoskill Agent
In this section, we present MUSE-Autoskill Agent, a skill-centric agent framework that solves complex tasks
by dynamically creating, reusing, and refining skills. MUSE integrates skill creation, execution, memory,
management, and evaluation within a unified agent loop. Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture and the
five lifecycle stages described below.

3.1     Agent Framework
The agent operates in an iterative decision-making loop consisting of three core stages: Planning, Action, and
Observation [37]. Given an input query, the agent continuously cycles through these stages to progressively
solve the task. This design enables dynamic reasoning, skill invocation, and adaptive refinement based on
intermediate feedback from tool calls and skill executions.

Planning In the planning stage, the agent      interprets the input query and determines the next step toward
achieving the task objective. This involves    decomposing the problem, selecting appropriate strategies, and
deciding whether to invoke external skills.    The agent may also leverage past observations and memory to
refine its plan, enabling more informed and    context-aware decisions.

Action In the action stage, the agent executes the planned step by invoking skills. These may include
retrieving existing skills from the skill bank or utilizing built-in functions such as skill creation and web search.
The selected skill is invoked within the agent’s ReAct loop using its built-in tools, producing intermediate or
final outputs for the task. The detailed execution mechanism of skills will be introduced in Section 3.2.

Observation In the observation stage, the agent collects and analyzes the results returned from execution.
These observations are used to evaluate progress toward the goal and to inform subsequent planning decisions.
Through this feedback loop, the agent can iteratively refine its behavior, handle errors, and adapt to complex,
multi-step tasks in practice.

Figure 3 End-to-end flow of MUSE-Autoskill. The Master Agent runs a ReAct loop; when a skill is needed it either
retrieves one from the Skill Bank or dispatches the Skill Creator to synthesize a new package (SKILL.md plus optional
scripts/ and, for code-backed skills, tests/). The Evaluator runs bundled tests when present and otherwise relies
on sandbox/runtime checks; failed checks send the package to the Refiner, while accepted observations are appended
to Memory and surfaced on later steps.

3.2   Skill Lifecycle
As illustrated in Figure 3, the agent organizes skills into a unified lifecycle of five stages: creation, memory,
management, evaluation, and refinement. To bootstrap this process, the agent is equipped with a small
set of built-in skills, including skill_create and web_search. In the autonomous self-creation setting, new
task-specific skills are produced through this mechanism; in evaluation settings, the same runtime can also
load externally supplied human skills through the skill bank.

Skill As illustrated in Figure 2, a skill is the basic unit of execution in our system. Each skill is packaged as
a structured directory with standard components, following Anthropic’s Agent Skills format [2]. It includes a
SKILL.md file that defines its interface, such as name, description, inputs, and outputs, and may also include
subdirectories like scripts/ for executable code, resources/ for auxiliary data, and, when the skill includes
generated code, tests/ for validation.
Skills are executed through a unified interface. At runtime, the agent reads SKILL.md to understand how to
use the skill, and decides whether to read resources, run scripts, or both. If scripts are required, the execution
engine runs the corresponding code with the given inputs and returns the outputs.
Using skills changes repeated work from open-ended reasoning into a shorter procedure call. The agent can
load only the skill interface first, then read the full body or run bundled scripts only when needed; reused
skills therefore reduce repeated exploration and make later runs more direct.

Skill Creation As illustrated in Figure 2, new skills are generated through the built-in skill_create skill.
When existing skills are not sufficient, the agent provides a high-level specification of the desired functionality,


                                                                                                                      6
including its purpose, inputs, and expected outputs.
Based on this specification, the system follows a structured pipeline to construct the skill. It first generates
the SKILL.md file to define the interface, then plans the internal structure such as scripts/, resources/,
and, for code-backed skills, tests/, and finally generates the corresponding files. The result is a complete
and executable skill package.
After creation, the skill is checked before registration. Code-backed skills may include a tests/ directory;
when present, the system runs those tests inside the sandbox and blocks registration until they pass. For text-
only procedural skills and code-backed packages without generated tests, the system falls back to sandbox
execution checks and runtime feedback from the source trajectory. If a check fails, the agent inspects the error
trace and invokes update_skill to patch the package before rechecking it. This create → evaluate → register
loop keeps generated skills inspectable and gives the agent a concrete failure signal for later refinement.

Skill Evaluation As illustrated in Figure 2, skills are evaluated before they are reused. For code-backed
skills, the strongest signal comes from unit tests when the package contains a tests/ directory. For text-only
procedural skills, and for code-backed skills without generated tests, the evaluator uses sandbox execution,
source-trajectory checks, and runtime feedback as weaker but still useful validation signals.
This process filters out many incorrect or unstable packages and records the reason for failure. As part of the
self-evolution loop shown in Figure 2, failed tests or failed execution checks can trigger updates or regeneration
of the skill. The result is not a guarantee of correctness, but a concrete audit path: each accepted skill has
either passed generated tests or survived the available sandbox/runtime checks.

Skill Execution As illustrated in Figure 2, skill execution is carried out within the agent’s ReAct loop using
its built-in tools. Given a task, the agent reads the available skill catalog and selects an appropriate skill. It
then reads the SKILL.md file to understand the skill interface, standard operating procedure, and required
components.
Following the procedure defined in SKILL.md, the agent decides whether to read from resources/, execute
code in scripts/ via sandbox tools, or combine both. Code execution is mediated by a small set of sandbox
lifecycle tools (create_sandbox, sandbox_run, sandbox_upload/sandbox_download, and close_sandbox)
that the agent invokes from inside its ReAct loop. Each sandbox is an isolated process / container with
its own filesystem, so failures, side effects, and resource usage are contained per skill invocation. Rather
than introducing a separate execution engine, skill execution reuses the same general-purpose tools the agent
already uses (file reading, terminal commands, sandbox calls), which avoids redundant infrastructure and
lets execution benefit from the agent’s full reasoning capability.
The execution process is iterative: intermediate results are fed back into the agent’s reasoning loop, enabling
progressive refinement and error handling. This unified approach ensures consistent execution across all skills
while preserving flexibility for both simple and complex tasks.

Skill Memory As illustrated in Figure 2, the agent maintains memory at multiple levels to support skill
reuse and accumulation over time. In particular, skill-level memory stores the skills themselves along with
their metadata, such as descriptions, inputs, and usage history. This allows the agent to efficiently retrieve
relevant skills for new tasks.
In addition, the agent appends notes and observations to short-term and long-term memory, providing context
for future decisions. These notes help the agent avoid recreating a skill it has already used, remember file-
format or environment quirks, and choose a known procedure before starting from scratch.

Skill Management As illustrated in Figure 2, skill management maintains the quality and usability of the
skill bank. Each skill is indexed using metadata from SKILL.md, including its name, description, inputs, and
outputs. At the start of each task, the agent is provided with a catalog of available skills injected into the
system prompt, following the progressive-disclosure pattern of Anthropic’s Agent Skills [2]. The agent then



                                                        7
selects the most relevant skill during planning based on this catalog, enabling efficient reuse and reducing
unnecessary skill creation.
In addition to retrieval, the system supports maintenance of the skill bank through three mechanisms: refine-
ment, merging, and pruning. When a skill fails generated tests or produces incorrect outputs during execution,
the agent revises or regenerates it based on the error feedback. When newly created skills overlap significantly
with existing ones, the agent can merge them into a single, more general skill to avoid redundancy. Skills
that consistently fail or remain unused over time can be removed from the active catalog. These operations
keep the catalog smaller and make skill selection less dependent on scanning redundant entries.

3.3   Memory
Memory plays a central role in enabling MUSE to accumulate knowledge and reuse previously acquired
capabilities. Our design builds on prior hierarchical memory architectures for LLM agents: MemGPT [19]
pages between in-context and external memory in an OS-style hierarchy, Generative Agents [20] maintain
a memory stream with periodic synthesis into higher-level reflections, and Reflexion [27] and ExpeL [39]
accumulate natural-language reflections and insights across episodes. MUSE extends these by adding a per-
skill memory scope tied to each SKILL.md file, complementing short- and long-term layers shared with prior
work.

Skill-level Memory Each skill in the bank carries its own .memory.md file, into which the agent appends
notes, lessons, and usage observations accumulated across tasks (e.g., known failure modes, input format
quirks, performance caveats). When the same skill is loaded later, this per-skill memory is surfaced alongside
its SKILL.md interface, letting the agent benefit from previously learned experience without re-deriving it.

Short-term Memory Short-term memory maintains the current task context, including intermediate reason-
ing steps, observations, and temporary execution results. As the context grows, it is adaptively compressed
by summarizing intermediate steps, allowing the agent to handle long-horizon tasks without exceeding the
model’s token budget during extended runs.

Long-term Memory Long-term memory stores persistent notes the agent appends across sessions, including
reusable conclusions, environment quirks, and general lessons learned outside any single skill (e.g., “prefer
batched I/O,” “the project uses pinned package versions”). Unlike short-term memory, long-term memory is
not subject to compression and serves as a growing repository of accumulated experience, enabling the agent
to improve decision-making over time by drawing on lessons learned in prior runs.

3.4   Context Management
The agent maintains context as a DAG of conversation nodes, one per turn (Figure 4). Each node records the
model response, tool calls, observations, and per-call token usage from one step. Every node carries two sets
of pointers: a mutable parent_id that defines the current active chain sent to the LLM, and an immutable
history_prev/history_next pair that defines the full history of original turns. The active chain is always
a sub-graph of the full history.
As tasks grow longer, the accumulated short-term context can exceed the model’s token budget. Existing
remedies span token-level prompt compression [7], attention-sink-based KV retention for streaming infer-
ence [32], and OS-style virtual context management for general LLM agents [19]; positional studies further
document significant degradation when relevant content is buried in the middle of a long context [12], which
motivates the explicit first/last pinning we adopt below. To handle this at the agent level, MUSE applies
adaptive context compression with two levels. Level-1 (single-node compression) scans the active chain for
individual nodes whose token footprint exceeds a per-node threshold (typically a large tool output or a ver-
bose observation) and replaces that node’s content with a compact summary while keeping it in the chain.
If the total context is still over budget after Level-1, Level-2 (chain compression) merges a contiguous range
of intermediate nodes into a single synthetic summary node, which then takes the place of those nodes in
the active chain. We always try Level-1 first because it is the strictly less destructive operation: only the

      All compression operates on the active chain only; the original 7 turns remain in the full history
      (linked by immutable history_prev / history_next pointers), so any prior state can be replayed or resumed across sessions.




Figure 4 Adaptive context compression over a DAG of ReAct turns. Each turn is a (plan, action, observation)
triple; the first KEEP_FIRST and last KEEP_LAST turns are always pinned and only the middle is eligible for compression.
Top→Middle: Level-1 rewrites individually oversized turns in place. Middle→Bottom: when no single turn is
oversized but the chain is still over budget, Level-2 merges the compressible span into one synthetic node. Original
turns remain in the full history (linked by immutable history_prev/history_next pointers), so the trajectory is fully
replayable.


offending node’s payload is rewritten, while the per-turn boundaries and the full plan/action/observation
structure of the chain are preserved, so downstream turns can still reference earlier turns by their original
positions. Level-2 collapses several turns into one synthetic node and loses that per-turn structure, so we
invoke it only when single-node summaries alone cannot bring the chain under budget. In both levels the
original nodes remain in the full history, so the active chain is always recoverable. Long-term memory and
the skill bank, by contrast, are stored separately and are not subject to compression, allowing the agent to
accumulate experience across sessions without loss.
In addition, the agent’s full state, including conversation history, skill usage records, and execution metadata,
is persisted as a snapshot after each session. This allows tasks to be resumed from an intermediate state
without restarting from scratch, which is essential for complex, long-horizon workflows that may span multiple
sessions.

4      Experiments
We first conduct experiments on SkillsBench to evaluate three aspects of our framework: whether skill usage
improves agent performance, whether MUSE-Autoskill can automatically generate effective skills from its
own experience, and whether generated skills can transfer across agents. We then evaluate the same agent
family on SkillLearnBench to test whether the skill-use and skill-creation trends hold on an independent
continual-skill benchmark.

4.1       Experimental Setup
Benchmarks We evaluate on two benchmarks designed for skill use and skill creation. SkillsBench [9]
assesses AI agents on real-world tasks that require domain-specific knowledge and tool use. Each task runs

in an isolated Docker container and is graded by an automated verifier that checks only the final output
files, assigning a reward in [0, 1]. We use the 75-task common set listed in Appendix A, grouped into four
super-domains: science & engineering, data analysis, document processing, and ops & planning.
We further evaluate on SkillLearnBench [41], an independent benchmark designed for continual skill generation
on real-world agent tasks. It contains 20 skill-dependent tasks across software engineering, information
retrieval, productivity tools, data and analytics, content and creative work, and utility workflows. Each task
has multiple verified instances, yielding 100 instances in total; each instance is also executed in an isolated
Docker environment and graded by an automated verifier over the submitted artifacts.

Agents and Models We evaluate four agents, all using GPT-5.5 as the backbone model: MUSE-Autoskill (our
method), Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes. Since all agents share the same underlying model, performance
differences reflect agent system design (including tool strategies, context management, planning, and skill
usage) rather than model capacity.

Model Backend In all experiments, Hermes, Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill use the same GPT-
5.5 deployment, gpt-5.5-2026-04-24 (reported as GPT-5.5 (04/24/2026)); in particular, Claude Code’s
model calls are routed to this GPT-5.5 deployment through a compatibility bridge. We did not override
decoding parameters such as temperature or top-p, so provider defaults are used throughout. Thus, perfor-
mance differences reflect the surrounding agent systems, including prompts, tool loops, context handling, and
skill-loading mechanisms, rather than different model backbones.

Evaluation Protocol For SkillsBench, each agent–task–configuration combination is run 5 times indepen-
dently in separate Docker containers. We report all-task accuracy over 375 runs: the sum of rewards divided
by 75 × 5. For SkillLearnBench, each of the 100 verified instances is evaluated once, and accuracy is the
number of successful instances divided by 100. In both benchmarks, self-created-skill settings use the same
denominator as their corresponding no-skill and human-skill settings; tasks or instances without a generated
skill contribute 0 rather than being backfilled with the no-skill result.

4.2   Effect of Skill Usage
Setup We compare each agent under two shared conditions: without skills (the agent relies solely on its own
knowledge) and with human skills (benchmark-provided, human-authored skills are injected into the agent’s
workspace at task start). For Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill, Table 2 also reports the headline
self-created-skill result under the same benchmark denominator. Hermes is included only for the without-skill
and human-skill comparison in SkillLearnBench.

Results Table 2 summarizes the main results on both benchmarks. Human skills improve every agent on
both benchmarks. MUSE-Autoskill achieves the highest no-skill, human-skill, and self-created-skill accuracy
in both settings, reaching 59.67% with human skills on SkillsBench and 72.0% on SkillLearnBench.

Discussion The consistent improvement across agents suggests that the skill mechanism itself is effective
under strict denominators that count operational failures as zero. MUSE-Autoskill leads both no-skill and
human-skill settings, while Codex and Claude Code are close when human skills are available. SkillLearn-
Bench shows a larger human-skill lift than SkillsBench because it is explicitly built around skill-dependent
instances, but it also shows the same automatic skill-generation bottleneck: self-created skills improve over
the no-skill condition, yet remain below human-authored skills.

Per-Domain Breakdown SkillsBench’s per-task category metadata is free-text, so we group the 75 common-
set tasks into four super-domains: Science & Engineering (18 tasks), Data Analysis (18), Document Processing
(14), and Ops & Planning (25). Appendix Table 9 lists the task-level category and assigned super-domain for
every task. Figure 1 and Table 3 report accuracy in each domain under both conditions. MUSE-Autoskill
achieves the highest human-skill score in 3 of 4 domains and overall; Claude Code is strongest in Data
Analysis.

4.3     Automatic Skill Generation
Setup We analyze automatic skill generation in detail on the 75-task SkillsBench common set. The process
follows a two-phase protocol. In Phase 1, the agent solves each task without skills. For tasks where a usable
source trajectory is available, we invoke the agent’s skill-creation mechanism to distill it into a SKILL.md and
optional helper scripts. In Phase 2, the generated skill is injected back and the same agent is re-evaluated
for 5 runs. Tasks without a usable generated skill are not dropped; they are counted as 0 in the 75-task
denominator.

Results Table 4 compares self-created skill performance for Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill. Self-
created skills improve all three agents under the strict all-75 metric. MUSE-Autoskill obtains the largest gain
and the strongest self-created result, improving from 46.95% to 53.42%.

Discussion On covered tasks, generated skills are highly effective: MUSE-Autoskill reaches 85.24%, above
its 81.17% human-skill accuracy on the same subset, while Codex and Claude Code reach 75.83% and 75.45%.
This suggests that once a successful trajectory can be converted into a reusable skill, the resulting lifecycle-
managed skill can match or exceed benchmark-provided human guidance. The all-task scores are lower
because 28–31 tasks still have no usable generated skill and therefore contribute 0. The primary bottleneck
is therefore coverage: generating usable skills for more tasks, not only improving the skills that already exist.

4.4   Cross-Agent Skill Transfer
Setup We test whether generated skills can benefit a different agent. We inject skills created by Codex,
Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill into Hermes without task-specific modification, and evaluate Hermes on
the 75-task common set. The source generated-skill banks cover 47 Codex-created-skill tasks, 44 Claude Code-
created-skill tasks, and 47 MUSE-Autoskill-created-skill tasks. Tasks outside the corresponding source-skill
coverage are counted as 0, matching the strict all-task scoring protocol above.

Results Table 5 summarizes the results. Here, “Covered” is the number of source generated-skill tasks used
for transfer, while “Uncovered” is the number of remaining tasks counted as 0. MUSE-Autoskill-created skills
transfer best to Hermes: they raise Hermes from 37.24% without skills to 51.90%, which is also above Hermes
with human skills at 48.02%.

Discussion MUSE-Autoskill-created skills transfer most effectively under the all-75 metric, improving Her-
mes by +14.66 pp and exceeding the human-skill condition by 3.88 pp. Claude Code-created skills also
improve Hermes to 45.97%, while Codex-created skills reach 37.01% and do not improve over the no-skill
baseline in this run. Transfer is therefore a joint function of skill representation quality and coverage; MUSE-
Autoskill and Codex have the same 47-task source coverage here, but MUSE-Autoskill-created skills are
substantially more effective when transferred.

Skill Generation and Usage Cost Table 6 compares the one-time cost of generating a skill and the per-task
cost of reusing it for Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill. Rows are computed on each agent’s own
covered subset (47 Codex tasks, 44 Claude Code tasks, and 47 MUSE-Autoskill tasks), so the table diagnoses
reuse economics rather than replacing the all-75 accuracy metric in Table 4. MUSE-Autoskill has the lowest
one-time token cost (364K) and is the only agent whose self-created skills exceed its human-skill covered-
subset accuracy while reducing both median tokens and latency. Claude Code self-created skills are cheaper
but slightly less accurate than human skills, while Codex self-created skills are faster but substantially more
token-heavy. The final block is a transfer diagnostic: Hermes remains the Hermes agent, but uses the MUSE-
Autoskill-created skill bank on the MUSE-covered subset; token totals are omitted for these Hermes transfer
rows because the current logs do not expose normalized token totals.

4.5   Generated Skill Capabilities
Aggregate Performance Figure 5 plots mean reward against cost for Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-
Autoskill on each agent’s own self-created-skill covered subset. Each arrow starts from the no-skill condition:
dashed arrows point to the human-skill condition, while solid arrows point to the self-created-skill condition.
MUSE-Autoskill shows the strongest pattern: self-created skills improve covered-task reward from 74.92%
without skills and 81.17% with human skills to 85.24%, while reducing median latency to 434.7 s and median
tokens to 499K. Claude Code self-created skills are cheaper than its human-skill condition, but slightly lower
in reward (75.45% vs. 77.75%). Codex self-created skills improve over its no-skill baseline and cut latency
sharply, but they consume more tokens than both no-skill and human-skill runs. The all-75 score remains
lower because generated-skill coverage is incomplete; this is the coverage bottleneck discussed below.

Case Studies We highlight three skills where the generated artifact carries non-trivial domain knowledge,
plus one regression.
(i) adaptive-cruise-control requires a discrete PID controller satisfying verifier constraints on overshoot,
steady-state error, and rise time. MUSE-Autoskill without skills achieves 40% (2 of 5 runs). The generated
skill implement-acc-simulation codifies the discrete PID equation, anti-windup, gain-tuning heuristics, and
the JSON file format required by the verifier; self-created accuracy reaches 100%. Hermes using the same
MUSE-created skill improves from 20% to 60%, confirming that the skill transfers domain knowledge rather
than memorizing the MUSE runtime.
(ii) flink-query asks the agent to author an Apache Flink Java job that reads gzipped Google ClusterData
traces, performs microsecond event-time sessionization, and emits tuples in an exact format. The baseline
solves only one of five runs (20%) because the agent cannot recover the project’s POJO and AppBase skeleton
conventions from documentation alone within its turn budget. The generated skill implement-clusterdata-
flink-session-query packages the schema parsing, the clusterdata.utils.AppBase extension protocol,
event-time session triggers, and a Maven-based validation recipe with synthetic gzipped data; Phase 2 reaches
100% across all five runs.

(iii) weighted-gdp-calc requires filling an Excel workbook with two-condition lookups and SUMPRODUCT-
based weighted means while preserving existing formatting and avoiding macros/VBA. The generated skill
excel-financial-formula-modeling names openpyxl as the right tool, lists the formula patterns, and
adds a verification step that recomputes target cells from source data; the baseline jumps from 20% to 100%.
Notably, the same skill description guides Hermes through the identical workflow without modification.
(iv) Regression: hvac-control. The largest MUSE self-created regression (80% → 20%) occurs on a task that
requires PI control of a first-order thermal simulator. The source trajectory used a calibration window and
gain-estimation routine specific to that simulator’s noise profile; when re-applied in fresh runs, the variance
in calibration data occasionally produces tuned gains outside the verifier’s stability margin. This is a case
where the skill encodes a procedure that worked once but is less robust than baseline trial-and-error, and
motivates the audit finding (next subsection) that some skills carry source-trajectory-specific assumptions
that limit out-of-distribution robustness.

4.6                  Analysis
Skill Quality Audit We manually inspect the 50 MUSE-generated skill packages covering 47 tasks for po-
tential benchmark leakage. None of the inspected skills hardcode expected verifier outputs, branch on task
identifiers, or read from ground-truth files. A subset of skills contain benchmark-specific assumptions such
as fixed file names, directory paths, or numerical ranges derived from the source run. These do not con-
stitute cheating but may limit generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. The structural distribution of
agent-created and human-authored skill packages is summarized in Table 7.

Skill Anatomy and Distribution Figure 6 and Table 7 compare agent-created skill packages from Codex,
Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill against 189 human-authored SkillsBench packages from the same 75-
task common set. MUSE-Autoskill-created skills are longer than the other generated baselines and human-
authored skills, but the extra length is concentrated in procedural detail: input/output schemas, verifier-
facing file conventions, failure modes, and validation steps. Codex and Claude Code more frequently bundle
helper scripts, whereas MUSE-Autoskill more often distills a self-contained textual procedure and uniquely
generates test packages in this audit.

Reward–Cost Relationship Human skills raise reward for every agent while reducing median wall-clock la-
tency (Figure 7A). This is the main cost-quality pattern: skills add context, but they also replace exploratory
reasoning with a more direct procedure. Turn counts do not uniformly decrease, so the robust claim is latency
improvement rather than fewer ReAct steps. Hermes, Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill all move
to higher reward and lower median latency under human skills; full latency percentiles for all agents are
reported in Appendix J.

Token Usage Token accounting is diagnostic because normalized fresh/cache traces are not available for
every runtime. For the agents with parseable totals, skills increase reward while changing the median token
footprint in different directions (Figure 7B and Table 8). Codex gains +12.78 pp for a +5.4% median-
token increase. MUSE-Autoskill gains +12.72 pp for a +10.1% increase, with most input tokens served
from prompt cache in both conditions (Appendix H). Hermes exposes total-token summaries for a subset of
runs and decreases from 483K to 406K median tokens under human skills; Claude Code exposes total-token
metadata but not the same fresh/cache split.

Cost Distributions Figure 8 shows the full per-run latency and token distributions behind the medians in
Table 8 and Appendix Table 14. Hermes and Claude Code have the lowest median latency, while Codex
has the largest latency tail. MUSE-Autoskill uses more tokens than Codex and Claude Code because its
loop carries the skill lifecycle and memory machinery, but the generated-skill subset in Table 6 shows that a
distilled skill can reduce this cost sharply once it exists.

Generated-Skill Cost Amortization On the 47 tasks where MUSE-Autoskill creates a usable skill, the gener-
ated skill is not just more accurate; it is also cheaper to use than both the no-skill and human-skill conditions
(Table 6). Accuracy rises from 74.92% without skills and 81.17% with human skills to 85.24% with self-created
skills, while median latency drops to 434.7 s and median token usage drops to 499K. Creating the skill is a
one-time cost: median 363.6K tokens and 156.3 s per covered task. Relative to human skills, the generated
skill saves about 139K tokens and 321 s per reuse, so the token cost breaks even after roughly three reuses
and the latency cost after the first reuse.

Bottleneck Analysis MUSE-Autoskill leaves 28 of 75 tasks uncovered in self-creation. These are concentrated
in Ops & Planning (12 tasks) and Data Analysis (9), with smaller clusters in Science & Engineering (5) and

Figure 7 Skill-induced tradeoffs in two dimensions on the 75-task common set. (A) Latency vs. reward. Human
skills move all four agents upward in reward and reduce median latency. (B) Tokens vs. reward. For agents with
parseable total-token traces, human skills increase reward with modest token overhead for Codex, Claude Code, and
MUSE-Autoskill, while Hermes total tokens decrease on its available summary traces. Colors match Figure 1.

Document Processing (2). This pattern supports the central diagnosis from Table 4: generated skills are
strong when a successful source trajectory exists, but Phase 1 exploration still fails to produce a reusable tra-
jectory for many difficult tasks. Future work should therefore focus on improving source-trajectory coverage
and on extracting partial diagnostic skills from failed trajectories rather than waiting for a fully successful
run.

5                        Real-World Deployment and Impact
Beyond the controlled SkillsBench evaluation, the skill-centric design of MUSE-Autoskill is already being
adopted in production systems, where skills serve as the common unit of capability shared across agents
and users. SkillMarket exposes the skill-creation pipeline to end users, distilling a successful trajectory into
a reusable, self-tested skill package without manual authoring; planned releases add skill management and
updating, so that deployed skills can be versioned and refined as tasks and environments drift over time.
ArkClaw integrates the skill-retrieval component as a find-skill capability, letting an agent locate the most
relevant existing skill before synthesizing a new one, and a planned extension treats an entire agent as an
invocable sub-agent, so that a single skill can encapsulate delegated multi-agent behavior.
SkillHub operationalizes the full skill lifecycle, covering creation, evaluation, memory, management, and
refinement, as a hosted service that gives teams one place to store, evaluate, and govern skills together with
their accumulated per-skill experience. Taken together, these deployments show that the lifecycle abstraction
is not specific to our benchmark setting: the same retrieve-or-create decision, bundled tests, and per-skill
memory carry over to systems built and used by different teams, and an improvement to a shared skill
propagates to every agent and product that depends on it.
Looking forward, we expect skills to take on a broader role as the primitive for defining workflows. Rather than
hand-wiring agent pipelines, developers will compose and version skills whose bundled tests and memory keep
the resulting workflows self-documenting and easier to maintain. This shifts ongoing maintenance cost from
bespoke glue code to a shared, continuously evaluated skill ecosystem, and we view these early deployments
as evidence that a unified skill lifecycle is a practical foundation for agents whose capabilities compound,
rather than erode, as they are maintained at scale.

6                        Conclusion
We present a skill-centric agent framework that improves task-solving by acquiring, reusing, and refining
skills through a unified lifecycle. By packaging reusable procedures as structured skills, the agent can avoid

rediscovering the same commands, file formats, and validation steps on later runs. MUSE-Autoskill integrates
skill creation, evaluation, execution, memory, and management around minimal built-in skills such as skill_-
create and web_search. On SkillsBench, it achieves the strongest human-skill accuracy (59.67%), the strongest
all-task self-created-skill result (53.42%), and the best transfer into Hermes (51.90%). On SkillLearnBench, it
again leads the compared self-creating agents on 100 verified instances. Together with production deployments
of skill creation, discovery, and lifecycle management, these results support skill packages as a practical unit
for accumulating and reusing agent experience across repeated tasks.

Limitations
Our evaluation covers the 75 SkillsBench tasks that all four compared runtimes can run locally, rather than
the full 94-task benchmark; the excluded tasks often have more complex Docker environments and may be
harder. Self-created skill coverage is incomplete: MUSE-Autoskill and Codex produce usable skills for 47 of
75 tasks, while Claude Code covers 44. Each covered-task skill is distilled from a single source trajectory,
transfer is evaluated only into Hermes, and with 5 runs per task, individual-task confidence intervals remain
wide. Full pairwise transfer among all four agents also remains untested.
A further concern is that each self-created skill is generated from one successful Phase 1 trajectory and
re-evaluated on the same task. Although the verifier is deterministic and no task-specific ground truth is
fed into the skill (Section 4), this protocol may overstate within-task gains. SkillLearnBench uses a separate
100-instance, one-run-per-instance protocol and should be read as corroborating evidence rather than pooled
with SkillsBench. Token traces are incomplete across runtimes, so token-cost results are diagnostic. Broader
benchmarks are needed before treating the gains as domain-general.
A remaining risk is hallucination in generated skills or in the agent reasoning that invokes them. Skills can
encode unsupported facts, brittle file-path or API assumptions, or heuristics overfit to a source trajectory.
Unit tests, sandbox execution, verifier feedback, and leakage checks reduce but do not eliminate this risk,
so high-impact deployments need stronger provenance tracking, adversarial tests, and human review before
skills are shared across teams or exposed to user-facing workflows.

A    Selected Task List
Table 9 lists the 75 SkillsBench tasks used for the four-agent comparison in Figure 1. We keep the original
SkillsBench category where available, falling back to the primary task tag when the category field is absent,
and group tasks into the four super-domains used in our analysis: 18 Science & Engineering, 18 Data Analysis,
14 Document Processing, and 25 Ops & Planning tasks.

B    FDABench Supplementary Evaluation
FDABench-Full [30] evaluates agents on heterogeneous data-analysis tasks. It contains three task families:
single-choice questions, where the agent selects one option; multiple-choice questions, where the agent returns
a set of options under strict exact-match grading; and report tasks, where the agent produces an analytical
report from database-backed evidence. The full public benchmark contains 579 single-choice, 760 multiple-
choice, and 668 report task instances. The underlying data instances span Spider2-lite, BIRD, DABStep,
and Spider1-style databases, with easy, medium, and hard difficulty labels.
We include FDABench as a supplementary stress test rather than as a headline comparison. The MUSE-
Autoskill score values correspond to the public FDABench data-agent leaderboard row listed as Data Analysis
Agent (ByteDance Lark Base & Hydra & NovaBase Team). For choice tasks, FDABench reports execution
accuracy (EX); MUSE-Autoskill obtains 74.10% EX on single-choice tasks with 281.4s average latency and
179.6M aggregate tokens (310.2K per task), and 49.70% EX on multiple-choice tasks with 183.2s average
latency and 166.7M aggregate tokens (219.4K per task). For report tasks, FDABench reports rubric score
(RS); MUSE-Autoskill obtains 85.20% RS with 96.6s average latency.

C     Skill Package Schema
A skill is a self-contained directory rooted at the kebab-case skill name. The directory always contains a
top-level SKILL.md written in Markdown with a YAML frontmatter block, and may optionally contain the
subdirectories scripts/, tests/, resources/, and references/. Skills that do not need code consist of
SKILL.md alone, which is the dominant pattern in practice. The skill identifier is taken from the directory
name, and the same name must appear in the frontmatter name field; this redundancy lets a skill be moved
or copied without breaking its identity. The schema deliberately mirrors Anthropic’s Agent Skills format [2]
so that skills produced by MUSE-Autoskill can be loaded by any agent that already understands that format,
without translation. The minimum viable skill file is:
---
name:        <kebab-case skill identifier; must match the directory name>
description: <one-paragraph natural-language description; this is what the
              agent reads when deciding whether to invoke the skill>
---

# <Skill title in Title Case>

## When to use
- Bullet list of triggering task types.

## Core principles
1. Numbered list of invariants the implementation must preserve.

## Recommended tools and libraries
- Concrete library names, CLI commands, or sandbox tools.

## Workflow
Step-by-step procedure the agent should follow at runtime.

Catalog routing. The frontmatter description field is the only piece of the skill that is surfaced eagerly:
at the start of every task the runtime injects a YAML catalog of all available skills (each entry containing
just name and description) into the agent’s system prompt. The body of SKILL.md is loaded only after the
agent decides, via the read_skill tool, that the skill is worth pulling into context. This two-stage lookup
keeps the per-call input cost flat in the size of the skill bank: a bank with 100 skills adds only ∼5–10K tokens
of catalog, not the ∼500K tokens that loading every skill body would require.


                                                                                       23
Subdirectory conventions. The optional subdirectories follow strict per-name conventions, so the agent can
rely on layout when reading the skill at runtime: scripts/ holds executable code (Python, shell, Node) that
the skill instructs the agent to run inside the sandbox; tests/ is used for pytest-compatible validation of
code-backed skills and is absent for most text-only procedural skills; resources/ holds passive auxiliary files
(data tables, prompt fragments, reference documents) that the skill loads on demand at execution time; and
references/ (used by some human SkillsBench skills) holds reference documentation that the agent may read
but is not expected to execute. When tests/ is present, failed tests block registration; otherwise registration
relies on the available sandbox/runtime checks described above. A skill never embeds dependencies: it relies
on the sandbox image (or runtime pip install via the terminal tool) for any packages it needs, which keeps
the skill bank itself a pure-text artifact safe to version-control and ship as a tarball.

Skill-level memory. Alongside the on-disk skill, each skill gets a sibling .memory.md file (created lazily on
first write) into which the agent appends notes, lessons, and usage observations across tasks. This file is the
concrete realisation of the skill-level memory described in Section 3.2. It is intentionally outside the skill
directory’s published surface area (the leading dot, and exclusion from any .tar the user might ship) so that
transferring the skill does not transfer experience accumulated from prior runs; experience is per-agent.

D    File-System Layout
This appendix documents the on-disk layout the agent assumes at runtime. Every path is configurable; we
list the defaults so that an outside reader can understand where each component of a published trajectory
came from in the run archive.

Agent home directory. On the host the agent runtime defaults to $HOME/.autoskill (overridable via the
AUTOSKILL_HOME environment variable). It is created on first launch and contains all persistent state that is
not part of an individual session:
~/.autoskill/
+-- skills/                       # the skill bank: one directory per skill
|   +-- pdf-form-update-redaction/
|   |   +-- SKILL.md              # frontmatter + body

|   |   +-- resources/            # optional: data / docs
|   +-- csv-summarize/
|   |   +-- SKILL.md              # the typical "doc-only" skill
|   +-- ...

|       +-- memory.md             # cross-session notes, lessons learned

    +-- 2d9b1c67f73947c4863b26a45c5098a8/
    +-- ...

Per-session workspace. A new directory under $AUTOSKILL_HOME/sessions/<session_id>/ is created for
each task invocation. The session id is a UUID-like string that also names the directory; the runtime persists
the agent’s complete state into this directory at the end of every session. Inside one session:
sessions/<session_id>/
+-- instruction.md                        #   the task prompt the agent received
+-- submitted_inputs/                     #   files supplied by the caller
+-- submitted_skillhub/                   #   any injected skills supplied at task start
+-- result_output_files/                  #   final artifacts the agent produced

The most important files for reproducibility are events.jsonl, which contains a strictly-ordered stream of
every plan / action / observation in the run (we use it for Appendix J), and ctx_state.json, the snapshot
used by the cross-session resume mechanism (Section 3.4). ctx_state.json contains the full conversation
DAG: every ConversationNode with its original input, the compressed_input (if Level-1 compression was
applied), and both pointer sets (parent_id for the active chain, history_prev/history_next for the original
ordering).

Sandbox layout. Each invocation of create_sandbox spawns an isolated process with its own filesystem
rooted at /sandbox (the exact backing depends on the sandbox factory: local processes, Docker containers,
or a managed sandbox service all expose the same interface). Files the agent uploads via sandbox_upload
land under /sandbox/inputs/; files produced by scripts go under /sandbox/outputs/ and are pulled back
with sandbox_download when the agent needs them. The sandbox is destroyed at the end of the session (or
earlier if the agent explicitly calls close_sandbox), so no skill execution can affect host state.

Memory file format. All three memory files (long-term, short-term, and per-skill) share the same plain-
Markdown format: an append-only writer appends a single block of the form
## 2026-05-07 10:34:33 UTC
<agent-written content, one short paragraph or list>
to the appropriate file. Read access is line-buffered and unparsed; the agent never edits or deletes existing
entries, which keeps memory append-only and makes the file safe to read from multiple sessions concurrently.

E     Hyperparameters and Runtime Configuration
Table 10 lists every runtime constant used in the SkillsBench experiments. All values were held fixed across
the 75-task common set; we did not perform per-task tuning. The values fall into four groups, each with a
specific design intent and evaluation role.

Compression thresholds. COMPRESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD (180K) is set just below the model’s hard 200K con-
text limit, leaving a ∼10% headroom so a Level-2 compression call can itself fit in context. NODE_COMPRESS_-
TOKEN_THRESHOLD (15K) is the size at which a single tool output stops being amortisable across turns and
starts dominating the prompt cache cost; below this threshold, leaving the original verbatim is preferable
to summarising. COMPRESS_KEEP_FIRST_TURNS and COMPRESS_KEEP_LAST_TURNS (both 5) ensure that the
task framing (the system prompt and the first few turns of grounding) and the immediate working context
(the most recent five turns) are always sent verbatim; only the middle of the conversation is eligible for
compression. In practice 5+5 turns are sufficient overhead even on the longest tasks we observed (max 69
turns).

Tool execution timeouts. The hierarchy TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (300) > VERIFY_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT_-
SECONDS (120) > TERMINAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (60) = EXEC_CODE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (60) reflects the ex-
pected wall-clock cost of each operation: a generic tool (e.g. a multi-step skill invocation) may block for
several minutes, the completion checker is bounded to a single LLM call plus diagnostics, and individual
shell / Python snippets are kept short to keep the ReAct loop responsive. MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (300) is
a guard against API hangs; on success the actual LLM call completes in 5–30 s. TOOL_TEXT_LIMIT (8,192
characters) is the hard cap on a single tool output before truncation, which protects the active chain from a
single misbehaving tool dumping an entire log file.


                                                     25
Retry and verification. MAX_RETRY (5) is the per-call exponential-backoff budget for transient API failures
(HTTP 429, 5xx). VERIFY_COMPLETION_TURN_THRESHOLD (4) is the smallest number of turns after which the
agent is allowed to call final_answer; below this threshold a verify_completion pre-check is forced, which
prevents the agent from prematurely terminating on tasks it has barely engaged with.

Backbone and agents. All four agents share the same model deployment, gpt-5.5-2026-04-24 (paper la-
bel: GPT-5.5 (04/24/2026)). We did not set temperature, top-p, or other decoding overrides, so provider
defaults are used throughout. The evaluated systems are Hermes, Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill
(this work, running its own backend as described in Section 4). Claude Code’s model calls are routed to
gpt-5.5-2026-04-24 through a compatibility bridge. Accuracy differences should therefore be interpreted
as differences in agent prompts, tool definitions, compression policies, context handling, and skill-loading
behaviour rather than differences in the model backbone. Every task is run 5 times in independent Docker
containers; the SkillsBench harness controls per-task wall-clock budget.

Table 10 All runtime constants used in the experiments. The same model-level settings were used for Hermes, Codex,
Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill. Hermes, Codex, and Claude Code inherit only model-level constants; their tool-
execution and compression behaviour is governed by their own agent systems. Tasks were graded by the SkillsBench
verifier in unmodified Docker environments.

F   SkillLearnBench Memory-System On/Off Ablation
We ran an additional diagnostic ablation on SkillLearnBench to isolate the effect of the MUSE-Autoskill
memory system. This experiment is separate from the headline SkillLearnBench table in Section 4. It uses
the human-skill setting together with a two-pass verifier-feedback protocol: in round 1 the agent attempts
the instance normally, the verifier is run, and in round 2 a fresh environment receives the original task plus
the round 1 verifier feedback. The primary verifier-feedback outcome is the round 2 result, and we also report
round 1 as a pre-feedback diagnostic. The memory-system-off condition treats every instance independently.
The memory-system-on condition executes instances sequentially within each task, restores the task-scoped
memory state before each instance, and copies the updated memory state back after the run so that later
instances can reuse accumulated observations. The round 2 prompt explicitly forbids saving oracle data,
expected answers, concrete final outputs, or other instance-specific answer keys into memory.
We report all 100 runs in each condition. For each condition we report both the first attempt (round 1) and
the verifier-feedback rerun (round 2). Accuracy counts verifier successes over the 100 runs in each condition;
token, turn, and latency statistics summarize the corresponding runs.



                                                                26
Table 11 SkillLearnBench memory-system on/off ablation under the two-pass verifier-feedback protocol. Each condi-
tion contains 100 runs; accuracy counts verifier successes, while token, turn, and latency columns summarize run-level
execution cost.

In this experiment, the memory system improves the round 2 verifier-feedback accuracy by +14.0 percentage
points (60/100 → 74/100). The same pattern is already visible before feedback: round 1 accuracy rises
from 48/100 (48.0%) to 64/100 (64.0%). The memory system also reduces round 1 execution cost (524.4k
→ 467.3k tokens/run; 12.7 → 11.4 turns/run; 419.1s → 347.7s). In round 2, tokens are slightly higher with
the memory system (408.4k → 423.9k), turns are essentially unchanged (11.6 → 11.7), and latency is lower
(338.6s → 295.4s). Overall, the result suggests that the memory system improves reliability on repeated
SkillLearnBench tasks without increasing the number of reasoning turns.

G    Compression Algorithm
Context compression is invoked by maybe_compress_history(ctx, model) at the start of every ReAct turn,
immediately after the agent’s response is appended to the conversation and before the next LLM call is issued.
The function returns silently when the active chain is under budget (which is the common case at the start
of a run) and only triggers an LLM-summarisation call when the total token estimate crosses COMPRESS_-
TOKEN_THRESHOLD. We implement two levels of progressively more aggressive compression; in our SkillsBench
runs Level-1 is sufficient for the vast majority of contexts that exceed the budget and Level-2 fires only on
the longest-running tasks (turn count >50). Both levels operate exclusively on the active chain (the linked
list reachable via parent_id); the immutable history_prev/history_next pointers are never rewritten, so
any prior state can still be reconstructed for cross-session resume or for post-hoc trajectory analysis. The
high-level control flow is:
def maybe_compress_history(ctx, model):
    chain        = walk(parent_id from tip to root)
    total_tokens = sum(estimate_tokens(node) for node in chain)
    if total_tokens <= COMPRESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD:
        return                                   # under budget; nothing to do

    # ---- Level 1: per-node, in-place summary on oversized nodes ----
    # never touch the first K=5 or last K=5 turns
    middle = chain[KEEP_FIRST : -KEEP_LAST]
    for node in middle:
        if estimate_tokens(node) > NODE_COMPRESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD:
            summary = model.summarize(node.input + node.model_output)
            node.compressed_input   = summary
            node.is_node_compressed = True      # reads return summary

    if recompute_total(chain) <= COMPRESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD:
        return                                  # Level 1 was enough

    # ---- Level 2: collapse the middle span into one summary node ----
    span    = chain[KEEP_FIRST : -KEEP_LAST]
    summary = model.summarize(concat(span))
    sNode   = new ConversationNode(
        is_summary       = True,

Cost. Compression itself costs LLM calls: Level-1 issues at most one summarisation call per oversized node,
Level-2 issues exactly one summarisation call per trigger. Because the threshold is much larger than a typical
tool output, the amortised cost is small (one extra LLM call every ∼10–20 ReAct turns on the long-running
tasks we observed). The summary calls use the same backbone model (GPT-5.5 (04/24/2026)) at provider
defaults; we did not separately tune them.

Audit trail. The original node.input field is never mutated. Reads through the active-chain reader return
compressed_input when is_node_compressed is True, so the active chain shrinks; reads through the full-
history reader ignore the compressed_input field and walk the immutable history pointers, so the original
ordering is recoverable. Level-2’s synthetic summary node has is_summary=True and, by construction, no
history pointers, so the full-history reader skips it and recovers exactly the original sequence of turns. This
means any compressed run can be “replayed” for analysis without re-running the agent.

Why not just truncate? A simpler alternative (drop the oldest middle turns when the budget is exceeded)
would lose information silently. Our preliminary experiments showed that on multi-step tasks the agent
revisits early-context facts roughly 30–40% of the time (e.g. to recheck an input filename or recall a parsing-
format detail); truncation forced wasteful re-discovery. Summarisation preserves these facts at ∼1/10 the
token cost, which is the regime where the LLM-call overhead pays for itself.

H    Detailed Token Breakdown
Token accounting is diagnostic rather than a headline comparison because fresh/cache token traces are
complete for MUSE-Autoskill and mostly complete for Codex, while Hermes and Claude Code expose total-
token metadata without the same normalized fresh/cache decomposition in the current logs. Table 12 reports
medians over available runs from the 75-task common set where that decomposition is parseable, splitting
prompt tokens into the fresh component and the cached component, and reporting output and reasoning
tokens separately for each condition.
Two patterns are worth flagging. First, both MUSE-Autoskill and Codex show substantial prompt-cache use:
median cached input is larger than median fresh input in every reported condition. Second, human skills
increase MUSE-Autoskill’s median token footprint, primarily through additional skill-catalog and skill-body
context, while Codex changes only modestly. Since this detailed breakdown excludes total-only Hermes and
Claude Code component rows, we use latency rather than token cost for the complete four-agent efficiency
comparison in Appendix J.

Table 12 Per-task token usage diagnostic on the 75-task common set. Columns are medians computed indepen-
dently over runs with parseable token traces, so “Total” need not equal the sum of the displayed median components.
“Reasoning” is counted within “output” by the model API.

I   Per-Domain Accuracy with Standard Deviation
Table 13 reports the per-domain mean accuracy together with task-level standard deviation, for each of the
four agents and both skill conditions. Standard deviation is computed across the per-task means (each task’s
mean is itself averaged over 5 runs); a high σ signals that the agent’s accuracy varies considerably across

tasks in that domain (some tasks land near 100%, others near 0%) and does not directly reflect run-to-run
noise.
Skills improve all four domains for all four agents in aggregate. The largest domain lift is in Ops & Planning
for Codex, Claude Code, and MUSE-Autoskill, while Hermes gains most in Science & Engineering. MUSE-
Autoskill leads the human-skill column in Science & Engineering, Document Processing, and Ops & Planning;
Claude Code leads Data Analysis. High standard deviations remain common because each domain mixes
near-solved tasks with tasks that no agent solves reliably.

J   Latency and Turn-Count Distribution
Table 14 reports the percentile distribution of per-task latency (agent execution time in seconds, excluding
the SkillsBench verifier) and ReAct turn counts. Both are computed across 75 tasks × 5 runs = 375 runs per
(agent, condition) cell. Hermes is the fastest runtime by median latency, followed by Claude Code, MUSE-
Autoskill, and Codex. Claude Code has a longer high-percentile tail than Hermes despite a comparable
median, while Codex remains the slowest median runtime. MUSE-Autoskill runs deeper loops than Hermes
and Claude Code, but its tail is shorter than Codex’s.
A second observation is that human skills reduce median latency for every agent while improving accuracy:
Hermes drops from 354.0 s to 327.3 s, Codex from 1013.6 s to 869.5 s, Claude Code from 347.3 s to 291.4 s, and
MUSE-Autoskill from 747.6 s to 730.8 s. Turn counts do not uniformly decrease, so the complete efficiency
claim is about wall-clock latency rather than fewer ReAct steps.

K    Self-Created Skill Stability
Table 15 compares run-to-run stability for self-created skills on each agent’s own covered subset. For each
task, we compute the mean reward and standard deviation over the canonical five independent runs, then
average these task-level statistics within the covered subset. Lower standard deviation and lower mean
absolute deviation indicate that repeated runs produce more consistent rewards, regardless of whether the
mean is 3/5, 4/5, or 5/5. MUSE-Autoskill has both the highest covered-task reward and the lowest run-to-
run dispersion: its average per-task standard deviation is 0.109, compared with 0.124 for Codex and 0.182
for Claude Code. It also has the fewest non-constant tasks (13/47) and the most low-variance tasks (35/47).

canonical five independent runs per task. “Non-constant” counts tasks whose five rewards are not identical. “Low-var.”
counts tasks with per-task reward standard deviation at most 0.1.

This stability pattern suggests that MUSE-Autoskill-created skills often encode a more executable procedure
than general skill descriptions. Human- or agent-authored skills can provide useful domain knowledge while
still leaving run-specific choices to the agent. In contrast, a skill distilled from a successful trajectory tends
to preserve concrete procedural details, such as command sequences, file paths, output schemas, validation
checks, and task-specific failure modes. These details narrow the action space during reuse, making repeated
executions more likely to follow the same successful path. The benefit is not universal: trajectory-derived
skills can also overfit to brittle source-run assumptions, as illustrated by the hvac-control regression case
study in Section 4.3 on held-out reruns.

L   Skill-Generation Failures: The 28 MUSE-Uncovered Tasks
MUSE-Autoskill produced no usable self-created skill for 28 of the 75 tasks under the strict 75-task protocol.
These tasks contribute 0% to the all-task average in Table 4. Their distribution characterises the current
limits of inference-time skill synthesis.
The uncovered set is concentrated in Ops & Planning and Data Analysis, with smaller clusters in Science
& Engineering and Document Processing. This supports the bottleneck analysis in Section 4.3: self-created
skills are strong when a reusable source trajectory exists, but coverage still depends on Phase 1 exploration
finding such a trajectory. A natural next direction is to extract partial skills from failed trajectories, capturing
diagnostic moves that worked even when the run ultimately ended at reward 0.
